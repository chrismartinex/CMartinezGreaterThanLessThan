The new edition to this program consist of the IF Statements to Compare different numbers, from the user input. 
The program will check and validate whether or not the numbers compared are equal, less than, or greater than. 
All while at same time, allowing the user to exit the program or re play as he or she wishes to!

Overall the code works how it's supposed to but i think you may have forgot the validation for the beginning 
but other than that the code looks and works great
